# Kick.tv Light Theme

  

A custom CSS to enable light mode on Kick.tv, this might help you to use the website without headaches if you are used to light themes. This only overrides the styling of the site. This project does not alter any functionality of the website.

  

This works by just inverting the color scheme of Kick, so certain elements (Like Emoji in stream titles or playback controls) may not display correctly.
